### Nominaion:

Dylan Salzman's accomplishments speak for themselves. Dylan has been playing Ultimate for 8 years, starting his freshman year of high school. Since then his ruthless ambition and drive to accomplish goals he sets before him have driven him to be one of the best players not just in division III, but in the country. There are three tenants to the Donovan award, skill, Spirit of the Game, and leadership. Dylan is not the tallest player, but he is head and shoulders above any other candidate for this award in all three of these categories. Dylan is playing this summer for the Ultimate U24 Men's national team. He played last summer for elite club Johnny Bravo, helping the team have a strong showing at club nationals. Dylan's throws are not fancy or frilly. He does not try to wow other teams or players with wacky scoobers or pretty inside flicks. His throws are exactly what they need to be to get the job done. And believe me they get the job done. Dylan rarely takes days off. He's always in the gym getting stronger and faster. This is apparent by his speed on the field and incredible cuts. Dylan has had to overcome the challenge of being of short stature. Every time I've seen a pass sail over Dylan's head, or a dangly tall person reach over him for the disk, I've seen fire in his eyes. Some people are tall and can make catches because they're tall. Dylan earns every catch and every sky. Dylan is an athletic phenom and his skill on the field is unparalleled. Dylan takes Spirit of the Game very seriously. I've never seen him make an wrong call. He doesn't get upset when calls are made against him. He garners universal respect from opponents and teammates alike. In the few games we've played against unspirited teams, Dylan has remained positive and spirited, setting an example for the rest of the team to not stoop to the other team's level, but rise above. All in all, Dylan plays the game fairly, and demands that others do the same. Dylan's strongest quality is his leadership. Let me tell you a story. It's 2015. The Middlebury Pranksters are not the team they are today. The emphasis is more on how fast you can chug a beer than how well you play on the field. Dylan's a first-year. He joined the team earlier that year and hit the ground running, working out constantly and working hard at practice. This has resulted in jokes about "Dylan the Hardo". It was uncool to work as hard as he did, but he didn't care. At Regionals that year Middlebury plays poorly and doesn't qualify for nationals. No one on the team really seems to care. Dylan is angry. Dylan commits himself to transforming Middlebury's ultimate program. Since then, Dylan worked hard to draw in athletes, promote a culture of working hard and commitment, and turn the focus of the team from beer pong to ultimate. He was elected captain as a Junior. That year the team was not looking so hot. We had lost a lot of seniors and were mostly made up of first-years. Dylan's immense knowledge of the game, and his emphasis on hard work and commitment brought the team from a group of beginners to a nationally competitive team. We placed third at nationals that year. This year we are likely the first overall seed going into nationals. From failing to a qualify for nationals, to being in contention to win it all, Dylan the Hardo dragged this team into success and glory through pure determination. There's much more I could say about Dylan, but that's okay because Ultiworld has said most of it. There's just one more thing I'll say. Throughout this year and last year, Dylan constantly has constantly reminded the team of one thing, in his words, "nothing is guaranteed." We have to fight for every game, every point. For him, nothing has been guaranteed. Back in freshman year of high school, short, scrawny Dylan Salzman wouldn't have struck anyone as a potential elite ultimate player. But he didn't care. Every sky, every dime throw, every layout has hours of work behind it, hours in the gym, hours practicing throws, hours watching film. Dylan Salzman lives and breathes Ultimate. There's no one else I would consider for the Donovan.

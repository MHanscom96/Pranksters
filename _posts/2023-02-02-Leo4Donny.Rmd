### Nominaion:

When Leo arrived at Middlebury, he was already a seasoned frisbee veteran, fresh off a gold medal at the WJUC world games, 4 years on his high school team, and several YCC seasons with the St. Paul Stars. He immediately made his mark on the Pranksters not just because of his skill, but with his endless enthusiasm, love for the game, and goofy personality. As a player at Middlebury, Leo has had an outstanding career, with the team winning the division 3 national championship in 2019 and finishing as the runner-ups in 2021. He has achieved many individual accolades as well: 2019 D3 Men's Rookie of the Year, first runner up for 2019 Club Mixed Breakout Player of the Year, and 2021 D3 Men's Defensive Player of the Year, in addition to a second team all-American in 2019 and first-team all-American in 2021. His impact on the team, however, goes far beyond these individual awards. Leo is the epitome of a team player, pushing his body to the limit in every game (in the 2019 final, he eventually had to stop playing because his hands were shaking due to how many points he had played in the 100Â° Texas heat). As a two-year captain for the Pranksters, Leo has also played a huge role in shaping the current and future direction of the team, sharing his passion for ultimate with the entire community. He always takes the time to give less experienced players advice, feedback, and praise, and over the last two years has welcomed many new players to the sport of ultimate. His goofiness helps the Pranksters maintain their trademark fun ~vibes~, while his talent, competitive drive, and leadership have been essential for the team's on-field success.

### Nominaion: Add another accomplishment to Walker Frankenberg’s growing resume. Already a 2019 National Champion, 2019 Rookie of the Year 1st Runner-up, and this season’s Player of the Year 2nd Runner-up, Frankenberg is also the Fall 2021 Offensive Player of the Year.

Quite often, standout offensive players are exceptionally athletic cutters or creative, incisive handlers. It’s rare to find the exceptionally athletic handler with creative, incisive throws. Frankenberg kept the Middlebury offense flowing, using a variety of release points and angles to hit resets and using his speed to constantly make himself available for his teammates. As soon as Frankenberg got a step on his defender, his matchup was at his mercy. Whether using that step to blast up the line, or stopping on a dime as the defender blew past trying to catch up, Frankenberg’s feel for and manipulation of momentum meant he always had his opponent in the palm of his hands.

Frankenberg’s numbers in the final sound like a video game box score. Two goals and six assists against just one turnover is impressive, but the advanced numbers show just how much the Pranksters relied on his brilliance. Frankenberg had 66 touches; his next closest teammate had 25. Frankenberg threw for 580 yards; his next closest teammate threw for just 160. It’s not traditional sports hyperbole to say that the Middlebury offense would have been lost without Frankenberg.

Coming back this spring for the second semester of his senior season, Frankenberg’s offensive excellence should be on display again in 2022. This time, he’ll be hoping it results in a championship.

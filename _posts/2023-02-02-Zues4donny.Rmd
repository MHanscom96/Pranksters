### Nominaion: 

Hailing from Northampton MA, Zachary "Zeus" Levitt is as deserving of this award as the golden god himself. As captain of the Middlebury Pranksters, Zach has exemplified the spirit of a great leader on and off the field. Having played frisbee for 9 years, Zach's talent and conditioning have allowed him to rise as one of the pranksters most formidable handlers, unleashing a variety of throws like lightning bolts and cuts in the handler space with the speed and voracity of a cheetah. As a sophomore, he helped secure the Prankster's 3rd place finish at D3 nationals, with a stunning 9 goals, 12 assists only to return the following year to clinch the national championship with his pink-clad friends, padding his stats with 8 goals and 10 assists . Zach's cool demeanor has made him a rock in the handler space, consistently being a strong and reliable presence. Off the field, Zach is an outstanding teammate, friend and community member. When the pranksters had to decide who should carry on the mantle of swan steve, there was no question that Zach was the right person for the job. A kind, thoughtful and warm friend, Zach is always there for his teammates, as a helping hand, someone to talk to, or someone to go on an adventure with. Zach loves his art, and odds are when he's not on the field, hanging out with his friends, or doing research for professors, you can find him in his room listening to music and creating awesome art. Zach has changed our team so much for being a part of it, and touched all of our lives, and we are so honored to be nominating him for this award.
